/* Write in your own words the following:
What are 3 things node.js has that the client side javascript doesn’t
have. And the reasons why.*/

//answer:
//node.js is a javascript runtime on the server and has global, process, file systems. the node js is for the server side ("behind the scences") and it doesn't need all the things the browser has, it has its own methods and properties.

/* What are 3 things the client side javascript has that node.js doesn’t
have. And the reasons why.  */
//client side (the browser) has window, document, local storage, it's everything that connected to what the user sees (ui). The window object is the window of the browser, provided by the chrome runtime, and documents is the conections to other DOM elements, it is something the node js dosent need it.
